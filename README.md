# Module2Challenge
Repository for M2 challenge

This project was a great learning experience becuase it allowed me to get more practice with topics that were discussed in class. It helped solidify some of my understandings with css through a lot of trial and error as well as tinker with the code to see what changes. 

It also helped me understand what and when to focus on something. Instead of working on the fly and changing and updating things willy nilly, I learned that i should take each bit of styling/formatting in steps. Once i feel as though something is finished or finished enough, i should be commenting my work as i go and understand how my changes interact with the entire web page before moving on and futher breaking my code.

In conclusion, I had a lot of fun with this project and am looking forward to refining my skills!

I took the reset.css sheet from the "solved" folder in the class activity: 12-Stu_CSS-Resets.
I asked my instructor if this was acceptable and was told that as long as I cite the source and added comments to show that I understand what the reset.css document does, then I should be okay.------------------------------------------------------------------------------
